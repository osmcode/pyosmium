.SH NAME
pyosmium-get-changes \- Download OSM change files
.SH USAGE
.SS pyosmium\-get\-changes.py
.sp
Fetch diffs from an OSM planet server.
.sp
The starting point of the diff must be given either as a sequence ID or a date
or can be computed from an OSM file. If no output file is given, the program
will just print the initial sequence ID it would use (or save it in a file, if
requested) and exit. This can be used to bootstrap the update process.
.sp
The program tries to download until the latest change on the server is found
or the maximum requested diff size is reached. Note that diffs are kept in
memory during download.
.sp
On success, the program will print a single number to stdout, the sequence
number where to continue updates in the next run. This output can also be
written to (and later read from) a file.
.sp
\fINote:\fP you may pipe the diff also to standard output using ‘\-o \-’. Then
the sequence number will not be printed. You must write it to a file in that
case.
.sp
Some OSM data sources require a cookie to be sent with the HTTP requests.
pyosmium\-get\-changes does not fetch the cookie from these services for you.
However, it can read cookies from a Netscape\-style cookie jar file, send these
cookies to the server and will save received cookies to the jar file.
